// Live view of sessions (the Rust station's live.rs): what a running turn is doing, told at its turning points — the phase
// (asking the model, thinking, working), each step starting (thinking, writing, a tool with its input) and ending — and
// the transcript's entries as each is written whole. What a step writes as it goes (the runtime's deltas) is not sent:
// a step's words come with its entry; how fast it writes is, now and then. Nothing here is stored: the steps in flight
// live in memory until they end, and the transcript stays the record, read as it grows and kept in memory while someone
// watches. Redesigned on one point (docs/station-ts.md, push not poll): a watched transcript is followed by the file
// system's change events (fs.watch), not looked at every 250 ms.
